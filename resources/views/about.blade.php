            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>
                This site is a simple <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> relay on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submit a website and our server will fetch the website using TOR.
            </p>

            <h5>Is this site anonymous?</h5>
            <p>
                No because you are accessing our server (torelay.com) without using TOR so we see your real IP.
                However, the website you are retrieving will be fetched under TOR so they won't see your IP.
            </p>

            <h5>What is TOR?</h5>
            <p>
                TOR is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis,
                a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential
                business activities and relationships, and state security.
            </p>
            <p>
                This product is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee
                fromThe Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.
